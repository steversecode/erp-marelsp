## 🔧 Plugin Installation & Management

### Installing a Plugin

To install a plugin, use the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan <plugin-name>:install
```

**Example:** Install the Inventories plugin

```bash
php artisan inventories:install
```

During installation, the system automatically checks for dependencies. If dependencies are detected, you'll see:

```
This package products is already installed. What would you like to do? [Skip]:
  [0] Reseed
  [1] Skip
  [2] Show Seeders
```

**Options:**
- **Reseed**: Reinstall the plugin's seed data (overwrites existing data)
- **Skip**: Continue without modifying the already installed dependency
- **Show Seeders**: Display available data seeders for the plugin

### Uninstalling a Plugin

To remove a plugin from your system:

```bash
php artisan <plugin-name>:uninstall
```

**Example:** Uninstall the Inventories plugin

```bash
php artisan inventories:uninstall
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Uninstalling a plugin will remove its database tables and data. Make sure to backup your data before uninstalling.

### Plugin Dependencies

Some plugins require other plugins to function properly. The installation system:
- ✅ Automatically detects dependencies
- ✅ Prompts you to install required plugins
- ✅ Prevents conflicts and missing prerequisites
- ✅ Validates the installation order
